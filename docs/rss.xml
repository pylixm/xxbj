&lt;h2 id=&#34;学习笔记&#34;&gt;学习笔记&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1、When the pandemic struck it was natural to fear that the world economy would stay in the doldrums for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; /pæn&#39;dɛmɪk/  adj. (疾病)大流行的  普遍的, 全世界的&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;struck&lt;/strong&gt; /strʌk/  adj. 受罢工影响的 v. 罢工，打，打击（strike的过去式和过去分词）&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当大流行爆发时，很自然的让人们担心世界经济将会长时间处在一个低迷的状态。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2、America is defying such pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;defy&lt;/strong&gt; /dɪ&#39;faɪ/ vt. 藐视；公然反抗；挑衅；使落空  n. 挑战；对抗&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pessimism&lt;/strong&gt; /&#39;pɛsɪmɪzəm/ n. 悲观主义&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;美国人无视这种悲观主义。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3、Having outrun gloomy growth forecasts from last summer, it is adding fiscal rocket fuel to an already fiery economic-policy mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;outrun&lt;/strong&gt;  /ˌaʊtˈrʌn/ v. 跑得比…快(或远);   超过;   发展更快;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gloomy&lt;/strong&gt; /ˈɡluːmi/ adj. 黑暗的;   阴暗的;   幽暗的;   忧郁的;   沮丧的;   无望的;   前景黯淡的;   悲观的;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;growth forecasts&lt;/strong&gt; 增长预测&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fiscal&lt;/strong&gt; /&#39;fɪskl/ adj. 国库的；会计的，财政的 n. 财政年度;   会计年度;   财政部长;   （苏格兰等的）检察官;   （西班牙及葡萄牙的）检察长;   印花税票;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fiery&lt;/strong&gt; /&#39;faɪəri/ adj. 燃烧般的；热烈的，炽烈的；暴躁的&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;自去年夏天以来，经济增长超过了令人沮丧的增长逾期，它为本来就很激烈的经济政策组合又加了一把火。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4、President Joe Biden’s $1.9trn stimulus bill, which he was poised to sign into law after The Economist went to press, takes to nearly $3trn (14% of pre-crisis GDP) the amount of pandemic-related spending passed since December, and to about $6trn the total paid out since the start of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stimulus&lt;/strong&gt; /&#39;stɪmjələs/ n. 刺激；激励；刺激物
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic stimulus 经济刺激&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bill&lt;/strong&gt; /bɪl/ n. 账单；议案（bill的复数）; v. 开账单（bill的第三人称单数形式）; n. (Bills)人名；(英、德)比尔斯;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stimulus bill 刺激法案&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;be poised to&lt;/strong&gt; 信誓旦旦; 随时准备着做; 山盟海誓; 做好准备做; 蓄势待发

&lt;li&gt;Be poised to do 做好准备随时做某事; 做好准备的;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to be poised 自信&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sign into law&lt;/strong&gt;  签署法律&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the amount of&lt;/strong&gt;  xx的总量&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;crisis&lt;/strong&gt; /&#39;kraɪsɪs/  n. 危机；决定性时刻；危险期 adj. 危机的；用于处理危机的&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总统拜登提出的1.9万亿美元的经济刺激法案将在本期《经济学人》出版后签署正式成为法律，这项法案使去年12月以来疫情相关的支出总额接近3万亿美元（占疫情前GDP的14%），疫情以来支付的总额约为6万亿美元。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5、On current plans the Federal Reserve and Treasury will also pour some $2.5trn into the banking system this year, and interest rates will stay near zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Federal Reserve&lt;/strong&gt; 美联储&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasury&lt;/strong&gt; /&#39;trɛʒəri/ 财政部&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;根据目前的计划，今年美联储和财政部还将向银行系统注资约2.5万亿美元，利率将维持在接近零的水平。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6、For a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 America’s economic policymakers were too timid. Today they are letting rip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;policymakers&lt;/strong&gt;  /&#39;pɒlɪsɪ,meɪkə/ n. 政策制定者,决策人&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;let rip&lt;/strong&gt; 让感情等奔放; 纵情欢乐; 无拘无束行事; 自由自在地行动;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在2007-09年全球金融危机之后的十年里，美国的经济决策者们都过于胆小。现在他们正在放纵。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;原文&#34;&gt;原文&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;audio controls=&#34;controls&#34;&gt;
    &lt;source type=&#34;audio/mp3&#34; src=&#34;https://img.eslpai.com/media/source/N-TE/2021-03-13_mp3/005 Leaders - The world economy.mp3&#34;&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEN THE pandemic struck it was natural to fear that the world economy would stay in the doldrums for years. America is defying such pessimism. Having outrun gloomy growth forecasts from last summer, it is adding fiscal rocket fuel to an already fiery economic-policy mix. President Joe Biden’s $1.9trn stimulus bill, which he was poised to sign into law after The Economist went to press, takes to nearly $3trn (14% of pre-crisis GDP) the amount of pandemic-related spending passed since December, and to about $6trn the total paid out since the start of the crisis. On current plans the Federal Reserve and Treasury will also pour some $2.5trn into the banking system this year, and interest rates will stay near zero. For a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 America’s economic policymakers were too timid. Today they are letting rip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probable result is a bounce-back that was unthinkable in the spring of 2020. In January America’s retail sales were already 7.4% higher than a year earlier, as most Americans received $600 cheques from the government, part of the previous round of stimulus. Stuck at home and unable to spend as much as they normally would in restaurants, bars and cinemas, consumers have accumulated $1.6trn in excess savings during the past year. Mr Biden’s stimulus gives most Americans another $1,400 each. Unusually for a rich country, a big chunk of the cash pile is held by poor households that are likely to spend it once the economy fully reopens. If vaccines continue to reach arms and America avoids a nasty encounter with new variants, the unemployment rate should fall comfortably below 5% by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is not confined to America. Manufacturing surveys are healthy even in the euro zone, which is behind on vaccinations and battling new variants, and is applying less stimulus. Mr Biden’s spending will further boost global demand for goods. America’s trade deficit is already more than 50% greater than before the pandemic, as the economy sucks in imports. But the rest of the world will not match Uncle Sam’s breakneck pace. On March 9th the OECD, a club of rich countries, forecast that America’s economy will, uniquely among big economies, be larger at the end of 2022 than it had been predicting before the pandemic. From April to September America is likely to outgrow even China, which is tightening monetary policy and has suffered a 9% fall in its stockmarket since mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surging out of a crisis that had at its worst moment cut the number of people in work by 15% will be a triumph for America, and will stand in contrast to the puny recovery after the financial crisis. Mr Biden’s spending will provide welcome relief to those whose lives have been upended—today America is still missing 9.5m jobs. Thanks to extra cash for most parents, the country’s persistent and widespread child poverty will fall dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, though today’s policymakers have a guaranteed place in economic history, they may not come to be seen as heroes. That is because America is running an unpredictable three-pronged economic experiment that features historic levels of fiscal stimulus, a more tolerant attitude at the Fed towards temporary overshoots in inflation, and huge pent-up savings which no one knows if consumers will hoard or spend. This experiment has no parallel since the second world war. The danger for America and the world is that the economy overheats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a risk that investors have been weighing up. America’s ten-year bond yields, which move inversely against prices, have risen by about one percentage point since last summer, on expectations of higher inflation and higher interest rates. Because of America’s pivotal role in the global financial system, its outlook for monetary policy spills across borders. In recent weeks Australia’s central bank has had to increase its bond purchases to prevent yields from rising too much. The European Central Bank was deciding whether to make a similar intervention as we went to press. Emerging markets with big deficits, like Brazil, or with large dollar-denominated debts, like Argentina, have reason to fear the tightening in global financial conditions following a turn in American monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is adamant that it will keep interest rates low and continue to buy assets until the economy is much healthier. Inflation will inevitably rise as a collapse in commodities prices early in the pandemic falls out of comparisons with a year earlier, but the Fed will ignore this. Under its new “average inflation targeting” regime, adopted last year, it is seeking to bring about inflation over its 2% target in order to make up for past shortfalls. That is particularly desirable because, for much of the past decade, the world economy’s problem has been too little inflation, not too much. Even if the economy eventually overheats, Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has argued that this, too, will be temporary. Longer-term inflation dynamics, he argues, “don’t change on a dime”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might they, however, turn on trillions of dollars? We have no reason to doubt the Fed’s near-term plans, but neither it nor the markets can predict the eventual outcome of America’s experiment. The Fed might have to pour cold water on the economy, raising interest rates to get inflation down. That would be awkward, given how much it has recently emphasised its obligation to seek “broad based and inclusive” strength in the jobs market. Higher rates would puncture asset markets and might also precipitate conflict with an increasingly indebted government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the chips on red
Mr Biden’s stimulus is a big gamble. If it pays off, America will avoid the miserable low-inflation, low-rate trap in which Japan and Europe look stuck. Other central banks may copy the Fed’s new target. Massive fiscal stimulus may become the normal response to recessions. The risk, however, is that America is left with rising debts, an inflation problem and a central bank facing a test of its credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This newspaper would have preferred a smaller stimulus. Alas, America’s troubled politics do not permit fine-tuned policymaking and Democrats wanted all they could get. Mr Biden’s gamble is better than inaction. But nobody should doubt the size of his bet.■&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;内容总结&#34;&gt;内容总结&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;本期封面文章为「Leader」版块《Nuclear power must be well regulated, not ditched》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文章认为，日本福岛核事故的启示不应该是逐步废弃核电，而是如何明智地使用它。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当福岛和事故发生时，世界各国一度停滞各种核领用计划。对核辐射带来的各种负面影响，反对情绪高涨。文章认为这种情绪可以理解，但是是错误的。监管良好的核电站是安全的，除了苏联时期切尔诺贝利核电站事故外，并没有造成过大量的人员伤亡。另一个，核能是目前最稳定的零排放的能用方式。向太阳能和风能等自然能力都不稳定，是间歇性的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;natural disaster 自然灾害&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;原文&#34;&gt;原文&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT HAS BEEN ten years since a tsunami laid waste the Pacific coast of northern Honshu, Japan’s most populous island. The tsunami and the undersea earthquake which triggered it, the largest ever recorded in the region, killed nearly 20,000 people, destroyed over 100,000 homes and threw the lives of tens of millions into turmoil. The direct economic cost, estimated at over $200bn, was larger than that of any other natural disaster the world has seen. And yet for many around the world the event is remembered for just one thing: the ensuing crisis at the Fuku-shima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earthquake cut the plant off from outside sources of electricity. The tsunami easily topped the plant’s sea walls, flooding the underground bunkers containing its emergency generators—a foreseeable risk Japan’s neutered regulators had failed to foresee. Because there was no way to cool the reactor cores, the nuclear fuel within them began to melt; amid fire, explosion and alarming amounts of radiation, a puddle from hell began eating into the plant’s concrete foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world looked on aghast. In Shanghai and San Francisco iodine tablets and iodised salt jumped off the shelves as people looked for prophylaxis of which they had no need. In Germany the chancellor, Angela Merkel, who had long stood with business leaders against the country’s powerful anti-nuclear movement, ordered its reactors phased out. In China the world’s largest new nuclear-plant programme was put on hold. Talk of a “nuclear renaissance” to fight climate change fell silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction, though understandable, was wrong. Nuclear power has a lot of drawbacks. Its large, slowly built plants are expensive both in absolute terms and in terms of the electricity they produce. Its very small but real risk of catastrophic failure requires a high level of regulation, and it has a disturbing history of regulatory capture, amply demonstrated in Japan. It produces extremely long-lived and toxic waste. And it is associated with the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Most of the countries outside Europe that use nuclear power have some history of attempting to develop a bomb. All these factors contribute to an unease with the technology felt, to greater or lesser extent, by people all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against all that, though, two things must be remembered. One is that well-regulated nuclear power is safe. With the terrible Soviet-era exception of Chernobyl, nuclear disasters come without large death tolls. It was the tsunami, not radiation, that claimed nearly all those lives in Fukushima. The other is that the climate is in crisis, and nuclear plants can supply some of the vast amounts of emissions-free electricity the world needs if it is to cope. Solar and wind power are now much cheaper, but they are intermittent. Providing a reliable grid is a lot easier if some of its generating capacity can be assumed to be available all the time. Nuclear provides such capacity with no ongoing emissions, and it is doing so safely and at scale around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, safe and productive nuclear plants are being closed across the rich world. Those closures and the retirement of older sites mean that advanced economies could lose two-thirds of their nuclear capacity by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. If new fossil-fuel infrastructure fills the gap, it will last for decades. If renewables do so, the opportunity cost will be measured in gigatonnes of carbon. Renewables replacing nuclear capacity would almost always be better deployed to replace fossil-fuel capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the closure of nuclear plants is largely a matter of economics. In places where emitting carbon dioxide comes with no price, such as America, the benefits of being emissions-free are hidden from the market. That hurts nuclear, and it should be rectified. When closure is political, the onus is on Green politicians, in particular, to change their tune. To hasten the decline of nuclear power is wilfully to hobble the world in the greatest environmental struggle of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument for keeping existing nuclear plants open has been strengthened, in some places, by one of the responses to Fukushima: greater independence for nuclear regulators. Britain granted new freedom to its regulator after 2011. So did Japan. Though grander hopes for reform after the tsunami bore little fruit, Japan did largely take the regulators’ hand from the power companies’ glove. Its new supervisor has made reopening mothballed nuclear power plants harder than the government would like, but that is as it should be. In Japan more than anywhere, nuclear needs to earn back trust to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This points to nuclear’s greatest weakness. In democracies it is expensive, owing to regulation and public antipathy, which makes new nuclear power a hard sell. The technology is thus increasingly the preserve of autocracies—precisely the systems where good regulation is least likely. Having paused after Fukushima, China’s nuclear plans accelerated as part of an effort to reduce reliance on coal. China produced four times as much nuclear energy in 2019 as it did in 2011; it has 16 reactors under construction and another 39 planned. Countries wanting new nuclear plants now look to China and Russia as suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strong case for democracies seeking to replace ageing nuclear plants with non-intermittent equivalents to join the importers. If Chinese reactors are designed in the knowledge that they will have to meet with the approval of independent regulators the world will be a safer place. At the same time, in boosting energy R&amp;amp;D to tackle the climate crisis, Western governments should be sure to give nuclear its fair share. There are real attractions to some new approaches, notably smaller reactors with lower unit costs: in platoons they can replace old plants; singly they can add incremental capacity where needed. They might perhaps be used to retrofit old fossil-fuel plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s critical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power has drawbacks the size of a tsunami. But with Chinese plants being built today that will not be decommissioned until the 22nd century, it cannot simply be wished away. What is more, it has a vital role to play in the fight for a stable climate. The lesson of Fukushima is not to eschew nuclear power, it is to use it wisely. ■&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;近年来英国的研发支出占 GDP 的比重不到 OECD 国家的 3/4，下周的预算案旨在缓解财政困境，提高生产率，其中激励创新尤其重要。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文章认为，资金对创新固然重要，但不是唯一重要因素。生命科学研究在帮助新冠患者治疗上的成功，反映了一些不太昂贵措施也能带来大改变。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;英国政府的快速反应是新冠疫苗得以快速推出的重要原因之一。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;英国政府努力消除研究人员获取健康数据的障碍，并允许患者加入试验。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;文章认为，良好的教育、欢迎移民的社会氛围以及友好的商业环境对创新至关重要。&lt;/p&gt;
